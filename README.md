# ISA_POST_card
Simple 8-bit port 80h listener for ISA bus with 7-segment display.

Based on EP2C5... development board from AliExpress: http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_II_EP2C5_Mini_Dev_Board, 
with unneeded stuff removed as described in the land-boards page to free some GPIO pins.
